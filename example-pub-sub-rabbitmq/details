I'm making sure I have `etcd` and `rabbitmq-server` in my local. Just now installing
`rabbitmq` with `brew install rabbitmq`

Okay, so rabbitmq is installed. I tried running it with this

```
$ /usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/3.8.3/sbin/rabbitmq-server
```

and it runs, which I'm able to check with

```
$ /usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/3.8.3/sbin/rabbitmqctl ping
$ /usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/3.8.3/sbin/rabbitmqctl status
```

But I think I can stick with `brew services start rabbitmq` ðŸ¤” But it said
something about the service restarting at login too. Not sure about that and I
don't want it to be always running, so, I guess the above is okay

Okay, so I got the code, and I don't know much about rabbitmq except that it's
a message broker and here they are using it for publish subscribe

So, I went to http://localhost:15672 - the rabbitmq dashboard and there found a
thing called Exchange and I created an Exchange named `ExchangeName` of type
`direct` after reading something about it. I also published a message with
`RoutingKey` value as `topic` and it didn't work. Hmm. The OP (Original Poster)
has also asked if we can give a working code for pub sub with rabbitmq. I think
that's a better thing to do first, to understand how it's all working!
